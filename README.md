# TourPlanner_4_SWENII
### This is Group4 which is planning a great TourPlanner.

First we formed a team of two students to develop an application based on the GUI frameworks C# / WPF.
The user creates (bike-, hike-, running- or vacation-) tours in advance and manages  the logs and 
statistical data of accomplished tours..
